## 🚀 Piscine Tips 🚀

### Week 1: Shell00, Shell01, C00, C01
- Don't waste your time on Shell01; focus on learning C and working on C00 and C01, as the exam is in C.
- Validate Shell01 on the weekend and work on the projects because they are crucial.

### Week 2: C02, C03, C04, C06
- It's better to validate C06 before C05, as exam01 is on `argc` & `argv`.
- Prioritize your projects over rush assignments.

### Week 3: C05, C07, C08, C09
- Try to enhance your coding skills and algorithms.

### Week 4: C11, C12, C13
- Focus on validating the previous days with 100% and preparing for the final exam.
